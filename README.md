### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Chris E. Hogue. I'm currently a 2nd Lieutenant in the US Army in charge of leading a signal Platoon in Fort Drum, NY. I commissioned out of the United States Military Academy with a Computer Science degree. I have experience speaking the parcel tongue (python), Scala, and C programming languages. My hobbies include cooking (with a special interest in baking) and calisthenics.
